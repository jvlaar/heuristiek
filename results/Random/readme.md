# Results of Experimentation with the Random Algorithm

## 20 houses

## 40 houses
As an experiment the random generator was ran a 4000 times for a map with 40 houses. Four runs of 1000 maps were done. The first run with 1 water body per map, the second run with 2 water bodies and so on. In this document the results will be compared.

### Results
The lowest value generated was 15628035. The highest value generated was 18187035. This means the range of values was 18187035 - 15628035 = 2.559.000

The results are plotted in this graph:
![Graph of random runs](Random-40Hs/random40.png "Random runs 40 houses")

The graph shows that there are very few outliers in the highest and lowest regions. This means generating random maps will generally not result in the high values that we are looking for.

## 60 houses
