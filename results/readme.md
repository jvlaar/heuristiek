# Results

In this folder we've gathered interesing results from the experiments we've run. They have been sorted in the folders of their respective alogorithm names. The 'random' map contains all experiments with the random algorithm, 'Hillclimbing' all those with the Hillclimbing algorithm etc. Depending on the experiment we provide a short description of the results, a picture with explanatory graph(s), a csv with map values and/or area files so you can load in the respective map itself.

The map 'Testing (all algs)'' contains screenshots of all kinds of different maps made during the testing of algorithms. These are by no means final products, but do illustrate the development process and the interface of the algorithm.

In the map 'LowerUpperBound' we put our calculation of the Lower and Upper bound of our problem. The lower bound is calculated exact, for the upper bound we made an exact calculation and a informed estimation.
