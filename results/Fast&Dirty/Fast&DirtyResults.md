## Results of Experimentation with the Fast and Dirty Algorithm
With this algorithm we tried to get a feeling for the values the maps with different amounts of houses could have. By placing the houses in rows, we got a quick result and could work from that.

Originally we wanted to make this a greedy algorithm (therefore it's name in the code base is greedy.py), but we quickly realized that the random algorithm created more valuable maps and therefore continued with that.
