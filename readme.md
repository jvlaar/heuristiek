# AmstelHaege - Team 3
We're developping a new neighbourhoud in Duivendrecht. There are three scenarios to build here: one with 20 homes, one with 40 homes and one with 60 homes, all with 60% family homes, 25% bungalows and 15% mansions. In this project we try to plan the neigbourhood with the highest monetary value.

## Prerequisites
This codebase will be written in Python 3.6.3. We will put all the requirements in requirements.txt, which can be installed by using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Authors
* Tommy Hokkeling
* Jos Vlaar
* Pim ten Thije

## Structure
In the folder 'objects' we've created a House class (which is inheritated by the familyHome, Bungalow and Mansion classes) and an area class to represent the map. Water will be added later as a seperate class. This entry will be updated as we expand our code... 

## Stickler Linting
This project uses Stickler-CI to check all pull requests for code linting errors and tries to fix them where possible.

## Git pre-commit hook
Everyone working on this project is required to install a flake8 pre-commit hook. This is to ensure good code quality and consistent styling.
